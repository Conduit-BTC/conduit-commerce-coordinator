### What is an NCC?

An NCC (_Nostr Commerce Coordinator_) is a server-based Nostr bot that:

- Is under control of, and represents, the Merchant on Nostr
- Subscribes to a relay pool
- Posts and queries NIP-15 events
- Coordinates the NIP-15 Checkout process on behalf of a Merchant
  - Inventory Management: verify, increment, and decrement product stock, create
    and update Stalls and Products on relays via signed events
  - Payment Processing: generate Lightning invoices, send invoice to customer,
    respond to payment events via webhook
  - Fulfillment Services: create shipments, notify fulfillment partners
- Handle Checkout-related communications with the Customer
- Notify Merchant when certain things occur
- Collect sales-relates metrics for Merchant visibility

To summarize the benefits of an NCC:

- Automated, frictionless checkout flow
- Direct integration with Merchant's existing e-commerce stack: inventory
  management, payment processing, and shipping service
- Separation of Checkout-related direct messages (containing ugly JSON) from
  actual human readable direct messages,
- General separation-of-concerns between Merchant's social graph and e-commerce
  activities
- Ability to implement additional commerce features, such as metrics collection,
  financial statements, subscriptions, and much more yet-to-be explored
  possibilities

### Why Medusa?

We have chosen MedusaJS as the backbone of the world's first NCC.

The MedusaJS framework absolutely shines for e-commerce, the developer
experience is unparalleled, the architecture is well-developed, the
documentation is as-perfect as it gets. The defaults are sensible. We get,
out-of-the-box, a complete e-commerce stack: Stores, Products, Orders,
integrations with external services, and powerful extensibility.

Conduit's primary task-at-hand is to transform MedusaJS into a Nostr Commerce
Coordinator. Currently, this implementation is a work-in-progress.

We're using [Nostrify](https://nostrify.dev/) and [nostr-tools](https://github.com/nbd-wtf/nostr-tools?tab=readme-ov-file) to handle the Nostr/Medusa dance.
There's a _lot_ more to come, so check back often, oh Argonaut of the
Nostrverse!
